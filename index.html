  <li>Lesson 1 - The Statement of Being</li>
  <ul>
    <li>The power of God is freedom. God is Good.</li>
    <li>GOOD draws everything. The Good we want governs everything we do.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Why do you move your right ? You move it to get your Good.</li>
      <li>Why do you breathe ? You breath to get your Good.</li>
      <li>Why do the stones lie still and wait ? They are waiting for their Good.</li>
      <li>Why does the bird fly ? They are waiting for their Good.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>The Good which you are seeking created you.</li>
    <li>My Good is my creator.  Combination of words which brought you forth.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>“I am seeking my Good, and my Good is my God, because it draws and pushes and moves me on.”</li>
      <li>There is Good for me and I ought to have it.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Get to speaking the word of Truth from the first to the last statement.</li>
    <li>The moment anybody speaks out the Truth of their life they have spoken the Omnipotent Principle. The unconscious truth is that there is Good for me and I ought to have it. Nothing can kill that unconscious feeling. It is indestructible. It is omnipotent. Thus the Omnipotent Truth is kept hidden in the stillness of the mind of humanity and the mind of the rocks. The Omnipotent Truth shall not be hidden in the stillness any longer, <b>and the satisfaction of the living things will come when they are told that the reason they move, or do not move, is for one Good.</b></li>
    <li>“Acknowledge God in everything you do, and God will direct your paths”</li>
    <ul>
      <li>To acknowledge God is to admit we are seeking our Good. It is well to give one day a week to acknowledging that we are seeking for our Good. We tell what our Good is. Is not our Good the free life we want? Do we want a burdened, obstructed, hampered life? Out of the word Good, name a good which is Good to you. (whether it's abundance or health or anything that is your GOOD)</li>
      <li>You can name your Good as free health. All nature will say “Amen!”, if you proclaim that the Good you are seeking is free health.</li>
      <li>). It is better for us to speak our own words, but if somebody opens the door for us it will teach us to open the door ourselves. That is, if we do not speak our words and so are not satisfied with Good, another may speak, and our satisfaction will come.</li>
      <li>God works in Truth. Tell the Truth of God and the Omnipotent God is moving.</li>
      <li>Stating what all creation feels. Seeking for Good (strength, freedom, support, unlimited supply)</li>
      <li>At the word that <b>There is Good for everyone and everyone is out to have their Good</b> each mind agrees.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Satisfaction comes through Mind. Speaking truth through the lips or thinking Truth consciously can bring all the satisfaction to the world which the world is seeking.</li>
    <li>We are told by Jesus Christ to take no care for ourselves. To sit down and proclaim to the universe that “My support is my Good, my Good is my God, thus God is my support,” is to stir the air to work with the mountains and seas to bring us our new provisions.</li>
    <li>After practicing the saying that your Good is your support, your old business will not be interesting to you. It will leave you, yet you will have your living. By and by you will have great and wonderful miracles of support come to you</li>
    <li>Names of our Good.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Love</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Love is the highest name of God.</li>
        <li>Fulfilling of the law.</li>
        <li>Infinite.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Life</li>
      <li>Truth</li>
      <li>Substance</li>
      <li>Intelligence</li>
      <li/>
    </ul>
    <li>
      <b>To expect Good and to be very definite in the mind that it IS coming, is to see it coming.</b>
    </li>
    <ul>
      <li>Many people would have their Good come instantly if they could name it, and have a clear idea of how it ought to be.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Truth is not slow. Truth is quick. With Truth, all is NOW. Jesus Christ said: “Now is the acceptable time!” (2 Corinthians 6:2)</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Lesson 2 - Denials of Science</li>
  <ul>
    <li>1. There is no evil.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>There is no matter.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>There is no absence of life, substance, or intelligence.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>There is nothing to hate.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>There is no sin, sickness, or death.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <li>If every woman, man and child expressed their idea of Good it would be found to be like every other person’s idea of Good.</li>
    <li>All I am expected to do to manifest the Good that is for me is to tell the truth about what and where Good is.</li>
    <li>You can take these denials and dissolve62 your hardest trial. Take one of your own trials and say that in Truth it has no reality whatsoever. Say that as God fashioned you out of Divine Goodness you have never had any trait of character which could result in an absence of Good. Say now that you reject the common feeling of the absence of Good. As God is not absent, Good must be here.</li>
    <li>We do not need to wait to be free. As God is free now, so we are free now.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Lesson 3 - Affirmations of Science</li>
  <ul>
    <li>It is your nature to be happy and powerful in proportion to your ability to appreciate what is Good.</li>
    <li>A poor child, looking through an open gateway into a beautiful garden, is filled with pleasure at the sight. Forgetting their misery for a moment, they have given their own character a new vigour of goodness and have increased the strength of their life in some metaphysical relation of mind to life. They have unwittingly given themselves a treatment for prosperity.</li>
    <li>The heart may still cling to its misery while it is observing happiness. Here is where the office of denial comes in.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Denial is elimination. In Science we are taught the value of elimination. The secret of freedom is in knowing what ideas are prejudices and should be dropped out of mind.</li>
      <li>By dropping the claims of misery, you step through the valley of the shadow of the apparent reality of misery, into the reality of blessedness divine.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>A strong Scientist said he had to meet all his lack of supply by a strong negative statement, or form of expression, or his mind would not work it out into view quickly. If he was requiring money he never said, “I am supplied with all I can use.” He said, “I do not need money.” And thus he made a clear way for his bounty to come to him. Some people who cannot sleep will fall into peaceful slumber by saying, “I do not need sleep.” For, you see, they made the word ‘need’ a great reality. It is the name of their belief in the absence of Good.</li>

  <li>Lesson 4 - Foundation of Faith</li>
  <ul>
    <li>The words ‘omnipresence,’ ‘omnipotence,’ and‘omniscience,’ are revealing.</li>
    <li>There is always one perfect way of meeting every situation and every affair so as to adjust it rightly and see it come out well.</li>
    <li>The main thing to do for a <a>[[demonstration]]</a> is to notice what sentences work quickly in your behalf.</li>
    <li>The first Lesson 1 - The Statement of Being ) is a statement of foundation principles. The second Lesson 2 - Denials of Science rejects whatever contradicts those propositions. The third Lesson 3 - Affirmations of Science rallies every idea that confirms them. The fourth tells our relation to them, as to why and wherefore our lot in life is as it is, and may become what we please.</li>
    <li>Begin today to practice this: Look into your life, look it over and see what you lack. Then tell the truth about it and be firm. See how it will come out. Faith means, to be firm. Faith brings things out all right. Firmness on the side of evil is stubbornness. It opposes Good. As evil is not God, there is not a particle of power in evil.</li>
    <li>There is one thing about your firmness that I wish to speak of. It is this: You need not try any experiments of putting your will on the patient, nor against evil, nor for Good. You may only tell the truth about God. The Truth is its own will. It is the omnipotent Will. You might get weary trying to exercise your will, but you would become strong from being firm.</li>
    <li>The truth that you speak asks only your announcing  it and standing by it.</li>
    <li>Firmness as to Mind, or Good, being the power, does not make Good come out right—it makes us see the Good in its true light. All is Good in reality.</li>
    <li>The musician thinks they are skilled at the piano because they practise hard. Not so. It is because they have in some moment covenanted with the spiritual feeling or ideal that stirred them, and it has come forth so far as to lead them to be willing to practise to give it more freedom. It is certain that if they really knew that it was the Spirit expressing itself through them, they would see that it is not the practice but their free mind that enables them to be a good musician. It is the Spirit that does all things (John 6:63). It is never anything else but Spirit that does all the good that is done.</li>
    <li>"I do not believe in a mixture of good and evil, I believe only in Good.”</li>
    <li>Evil always seems very real and very powerful, until met with the Truth.</li>
    <li>I believe in prosperity and success.</li>
